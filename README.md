# Snake Java 2D Game

It is a simple Java 2D Snake game. The game is implemented using Java 2D graphics library and threads.

It has three different levels (Easy, Normal, and Hard). The game has some basic features like player scoring, timer, and an interesting sound.

The used IDE is Eclipse (I uploaded all project artifacts), also the game JAR file is uploaded.

If you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so :)
